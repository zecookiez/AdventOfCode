# AdventOfCode üéÑ
This is my full repository of my solutions for Advent of Code in the spirit of the holidays, I figured it would be better to put all of them into one collective repository instead of making a new one every year (oops)

(most of) my solutions will be written in Python with the following goals in mind:
1. __Efficiency,__ where an efficient algorithm will do the job without over-killing the problem. I am aiming for a cumulative sub-15 seconds using plain Python 3 (no PyPy or JIT compilers) for these tasks.
2. __Organization.__ Avoid duplicate code for better readability and modularity. No üçù code!
3. __Keep it simple!__

There were a few years where I tried to go for the global leaderboard and others where I gave up (see 2019 and 2018 to some extent). My stats, comments, and thoughts for each respective year are in their own folders.
