# AdventOfCode2023
A series of challenges in the spirit of the holidays for 2023 üéÑ

All of these solutions will be written in Python with the following goals in mind:
1. __Efficiency,__ where an efficient algorithm will do the job without over-killing the problem. I am aiming for a cumulative sub-15 seconds using plain Python 3.10 (no pypy) for these tasks.
2. __Organization.__ Avoid duplicate code for better readability and modularity. No üçù code!
3. __Keep it simple!__

I'm doing an internship on the west coast this year, so my sleep isn't ruined! I'll try to get on the global leaderboard, but every year I have less time to both participate and practice. Hoping to take this year's advent less seriously.

## Final Thoughts 

No personal best and getting less points from previous years :"D but this felt like the most consistent year and I have very few regrets. The only thing stopping me from getting points is typing concise python code and solving the harder problems, and both of these issues came from the lack of practice x(

This is my first year getting < 10 seconds cumulative code and I had a good time optimizing my solutions (Day 21 and 25 were particularly fun to optimize!). It also turns out doing it on the west coast was a lot more enjoyable than in the east coast, same for when there's no ongoing finals. Day 24 and 25 were doomed because I was flying back to Canada with no sleep.

Would love to do it again next year since it's the 10th AOC next year, but that would be on a school term with finals and internship job search :( see you next year!
