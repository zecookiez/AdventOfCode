# AdventOfCode2023
A series of challenges in the spirit of the holidays for 2023 üéÑ

All of these solutions will be written in Python with the following goals in mind:
1. __Efficiency,__ where an efficient algorithm will do the job without over-killing the problem. I am aiming for a cumulative sub-15 seconds using plain Python 3 for these tasks.
2. __Organization.__ Avoid duplicate code for better readability and modularity. No üçù code!
3. __Keep it simple!__

I'm doing co-op on the west coast this year, so my sleep isn't ruined! I'll try to get on the global leaderboard, but every year I have less time to both participate and practice. Hoping to take this year's advent less seriously.
