## AdventOfCode2018
A series of challenges in spirit of the holidays ðŸŽ„

All of these solutions will be written and verified with Python, along with the following goals:
1. __Efficiency,__ where a more efficient algorithm will do the job without over-killing the problem. I am aiming for sub-15 seconds for these tasks.
2. __Organization.__ Avoid duplicate code for better readability.
3. __Keep it simple!__
